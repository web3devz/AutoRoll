## 🛠️ Key Technologies Implemented

### Smart Contract (AssemblyScript)
- **Massa Autonomous Smart Contracts (ASC)**: Self-executing payroll logic
- **Employee Management**: Add/remove employees with configurable salaries
- **Autonomous Execution**: Scheduled payments without external triggers
- **Owner Controls**: Secure admin functions for contract management
- **Event Logging**: Complete audit trail of all operations

### Frontend (TypeScript + HTML)
- **Massa Wallet Integration**: Secure wallet connection and signing
- **Dual Dashboards**: Separate interfaces for employers and employees
- **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refreshing contract statistics
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface
- **Transaction Management**: Loading states and error handling

### Key Features Implemented
✅ **Employee Registration**: Wallet address, salary, payment interval
✅ **Contract Funding**: Deposit MAS tokens for payroll
✅ **Autonomous Payments**: ASC-powered automatic salary distribution
✅ **Bonus System**: One-time bonus payments to employees
✅ **Employee Dashboard**: Status checking and payment history
✅ **Owner Controls**: Add/remove employees, fund contract
✅ **Statistics Tracking**: Real-time contract metrics
✅ **Event System**: Comprehensive logging and notifications

## 🔧 Smart Contract Functions

### Owner Functions
- `constructor()`: Initialize contract with deployer as owner
- `addEmployee(address, salary, interval)`: Register new employee
- `removeEmployee(address)`: Deactivate employee payments
- `fundContract()`: Add MAS tokens to contract balance
- `issueBonus(address, amount)`: Send one-time bonus payment
- `startAutonomousExecution()`: Begin automatic salary processing

### Public Functions  
- `getEmployee(address)`: Retrieve employee information
- `getContractStats()`: Get contract statistics (balance, count, total paid)
- `getOwner()`: Get contract owner address
- `processSalaries()`: Process due salary payments (called autonomously)

### Autonomous Logic
- **Scheduled Execution**: Runs every 60 seconds automatically
- **Payment Processing**: Checks all employees for due payments
- **Balance Management**: Handles insufficient funds gracefully
- **State Updates**: Updates next payment times and totals

## 🌐 Frontend Features
